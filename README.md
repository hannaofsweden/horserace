## Implemntation notes

-   The app is generated using Next.js, a framework similar to create-react-app. It doesn't have the concept of ejection mentioned in the the task description. Instead, configuration can be changed in the next.config.js file.
-   The app uses Ant Design as the UI component library.
-   Since styling wasn't mentioned in the task description, I've only applied the most basic styling.
